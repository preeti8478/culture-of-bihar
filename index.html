        <p></p>🔱 Why is Maha Shivratri Celebrated?
Maha Shivratri is a major Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva, observed every year on the 14th night (Chaturdashi) of the waning moon in the month of Phalguna (February–March). It is celebrated for several reasons:
Marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati
It is believed that on this night, Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati. Hence, the day is celebrated as their divine wedding anniversary.
Appearance of Shiva as a Linga (Shivlinga)
According to another legend, Shiva appeared as a massive pillar of fire (linga form) to settle a dispute between Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu over who was the greatest.
Churning of the Ocean (Samudra Manthan) and Shiva Drinking Poison
During the churning of the cosmic ocean, a deadly poison called Halahala emerged. To save the world, Shiva drank the poison, holding it in his throat, which turned blue. This act of sacrifice is commemorated on Maha Shivratri.
📅 When is Maha Shivratri Celebrated?
It is celebrated on the 14th day (Chaturdashi) of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the Hindu month of Phalguna.
In the Gregorian calendar, it usually falls in February or March.
🙏 Why Should We Celebrate Maha Shivratri?
It is a spiritually significant night for meditation, self-purification, and connecting with divine consciousness.
Devotees observe fasts, stay awake all night (Jagran), chant mantras like "Om Namah Shivaya", and perform special prayers and offerings (abhishek) to Shivling.
It is believed to help one overcome ignorance, gain inner peace, and even attain moksha (liberation).
