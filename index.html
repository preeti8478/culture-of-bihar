        <p><strong>Madhubani Painting</strong> Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, is an ancient folk art form from the Mithila region of Bihar. It is believed to have originated thousands of years ago when King Janak ordered the city to be decorated for the wedding of his daughter Sita. Since then, this art has been created on the walls and courtyards of homes.
In the beginning, women used to paint these artworks on the walls of their houses using natural colors and fingers or wooden sticks. The paintings are usually based on themes such as religious stories, nature, deities, marriage, and local folklore. Over time, this art form began to appear on paper, cloth, and canvas as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Bihar idols</strong>Bihar has been a sacred land in ancient India where religious, cultural, and artistic consciousness reached remarkable heights. The idols created here were not merely objects of worship, but powerful symbols of society, spirituality, and craftsmanship.
During the Maurya period (322â€“185 BCE), Bihar witnessed the creation of some of the most iconic sculptures, such as the Ashokan pillars, the lion capitals, and the Dharma Chakra (Wheel of Dharma). The city of Pataliputra served as a major cultural and political center during this time.
Following this era, the Gupta period (4thâ€“6th century CE) is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Indian sculpture. Exquisite and expressive idols of Lord Buddha, Vishnu, Shiva, and Goddess Lakshmi were crafted during this time. These sculptures, often made of black stone or bronze, are notable for their spiritual depth and intricate detailing that reflect the devotion and artistic mastery of the period.</p>

        <p><strong>Kathak Dance</strong>Kathak is one of the ancient classical dance forms of Bihar, which presents stories, expressions, and the sweet rhythm of anklets to convey themes of devotion and love."
"It originated in the temples of ancient India, where storytellers called 'Kathakars' used dance to narrate tales celebrating the glory of the gods."
"Kathak also flourished in the Mughal courts, where intricate footwork, graceful spins, and rhythmic patterns gave this dance form a royal and refined character.</p>

        <p><strong>Jhijhiya Dance</strong>Jhijhiya is a traditional folk dance of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, performed especially by women during the Navratri festival. The dance is deeply rooted in rural life and the worship of goddess Durga or Lakshmi, and it is offered as a prayer for the well-being and protection of the family.
In this dance, women carry earthen pots with holes on their heads, which have a lit lamp inside, and perform in groups. These pots symbolize devotion, belief, and the light that wards off darkness and evil forces.
It is believed that Jhijhiya dance is performed to protect the village from negative energies and to bring peace, prosperity, and harmony. The dance beautifully combines traditional songs, rhythm, coordination, and collective spiritual energy.</p>
